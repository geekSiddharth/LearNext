# LearNext

My hack for my first Byld Hackathon.  Won the first prize. :D 

The basic aim of this project is to create a to-do list for students that lays emphasis on developing skills(rather than monotonous preparation for exams). It focused on long-term learning by dividing the topics into proper orders of skills required(inspired by KhanAcademy) and then automatically generating an awesome revision plan.
